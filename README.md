React, which was created by Facebook, is an open source JavaScript library, built for handling user interfaces. It is used to create reusable components, handle state and props, utilized event listners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes.

React fuzes HTML and JS to create its own markup language, JSX.

The files in this repository are individual lessons that go through creating JSX elements, components, and inputs, as well as using higher order functions and rendering data to create a slicker user interface.
